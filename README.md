# Line-Follower-Robot
The circuit includes an 8051 microcontroller, two IR sensors, motors, and a motor driver IC. The IR sensors, placed at the front of the robot, detect line contrast to guide its movement. The robot moves based on sensor outputs, following a black line with high output and adjusting direction when deviating from the path
